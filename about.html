                    <span class="logo-about home-link">Game<span class="p-logo">P</span></span> is a free-to-play gaming website, inspired by the Y8 website, when Y8
                    removed all the flash games after Adobe stopped supporting Flash Player because of its vulnerability against cyber attacks. <span class="logo-about home-link">Game<span class="p-logo">P</span></span>
                    exists not to revive the old flash games nor to replace them, but to make people remember how fun it was to play those games back then.

                    Hi I'm Simone, the developer of this website, as you may already know I'm a game addict (and that's an understatement), not only do I enjoy
                    playing games but also making them, but since I suck at programming and I'm into reading more, the type of games that I like to play and make are 
                    interactive novels since their easy to make, interactive novels will be available soon in the website when John the freaking hacker is gone.
                    Well that's all I have to say for now, enjoy the games when security gets better and hope that I don't do a Flash on you guys. You may press 
                    the logo in the upper left corner to go back home.
